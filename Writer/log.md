# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<u></u>

### Day 1: November 20, 2019 
<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Installed express js and built a plain and simple app.

<strong>Thoughts</strong>: For now it looks like I am going to be using tools very different from the previous one I have. I can't wait.

### Day 2: November 21, 2019
<strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Studied the express folder structure, created routes for sign up and login and designed views for the routes.

<strong>Thoughts</strong>: Though I have not really done anything challenging, I really like the folder structure because it was easy to understand and the fact that it encourages subconcious design of readable code is really cool. I really look forward to Day 3's task.
